Hi Guido, this is a test of the system.
I have Mtn Dew as my drink.

HTML Markdown Practice:

# Headings

Headings such as the one above can be marked with a spaced #. The number of #'s depends on the heading level, 1-6.
For best practice, leave a blank line above and below your heading.


# Paragraphs

Paragraphs can be created by writing lines of text separated from other text by blank lines. 

This, for example, is a separate paragraph from the one above.

It's best to keep paragraphs left-aligned on the page, things can go weird otherwise.

# Line Breaks

Line breaks are a bit tricky, most software will accept two spaces after a line followed by hitting the enter/return key. However, it can be hard to identify these double spaces, so it is easier to simply use the HTML <br> tag.

# Emphasis

You can add emphisis by making text bold or italic.

## Bold

You can bold text by adding 2 asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase.

**I am bold**

__I am also bold__

For emphasising the middle of a word, surround the desired letters with double asterisks. Most software don't work with underscores in this case.

Is**tan**bul is a place that would be neat to visit.

## Italic

To italicize text, use one asterisk or underscore instead of two.

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.

To italicize the middle of a word, add asterisks without spaces.

A*cat*meow
